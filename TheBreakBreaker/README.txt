Advanced Audiovisual Processing
Portfolio Project 2

This project contains important audio files in the data folder.

It is an Open Frameworks project using the ofxMaxim addon, as well as the GUI addon.

Note: parts of this code were developed collaboratively with Callum Magill â€“ namely the algorithms that chop up the sample and play it back at the correct speeds. (cmagi001@gold.ac.uk).
